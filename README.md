# 😷 Face Mask Detection using CNN

This is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image classification project that detects whether a person in an image is **wearing a face mask or not**. The model is trained using the **Face Mask Dataset** from Kaggle and achieves high accuracy through preprocessing, augmentation, and model tuning.

## 🧠 Project Overview

With the increased need for public health safety, face mask detection has become crucial in various applications such as surveillance systems, public transport, and corporate environments. This project builds a **binary image classifier** using **TensorFlow/Keras** that classifies images into:
- `1` → **With Mask**
- `0` → **Without Mask**
